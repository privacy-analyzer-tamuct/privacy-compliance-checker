step6_agentic_kg_discovery.py
──────────────────────────────
A genuinely agentic version of policy discovery, as distinct from the
fixed pipeline in agentic_policy_update_crawler.py.

WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE EXISTING PIPELINE
────────────────────────────────────────────
discover_policy_url_agent() in agentic_policy_update_crawler.py always
runs the same hardcoded sequence:
    search -> fetch candidates -> validate -> ask LLM to pick one

The LLM only ever gets to make ONE decision (which candidate to pick).
Every other step — how many searches, which pages to fetch, whether to
consult the knowledge graph at all — is decided by your Python code,
not the model.

This module instead gives the model a small toolbox:

    query_graph(sparql)   -- read-only SPARQL query against the live KG
    search_web(query)     -- Brave search, returns titles/snippets/urls
    fetch_url(url)        -- fetches a page and returns cleaned text

...and runs a loop where the MODEL decides which tool to call, how many
times, in what order, until it has enough information to answer. This
is the "agent reasons over the graph" pattern: the KG becomes something
the model can consult mid-task, not just a place results get written
to afterward.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR USE CASE SPECIFICALLY
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
The model can now do things the fixed pipeline structurally cannot:
  - Check what regulatory classes a manufacturer is currently scored
    against BEFORE deciding how to search, so it can specifically look
    for whether THOSE sections changed (rather than treating policy
    text as one undifferentiated blob).
  - Check the manufacturer's last recorded modification date and
    skip an expensive multi-query search if it already has strong
    context from a prior run.
  - Decide on its own that one search wasn't enough and issue a
    second, differently-phrased one — instead of always running the
    same fixed 4 query templates regardless of how the first one went.

SAFETY NOTE
───────────
query_graph() is READ-ONLY by construction — it rejects anything other
than SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE queries. The model can look at the
graph, but cannot use this tool to write to it. All writes still go
through step4a_timestamps.upsert_policy(), called explicitly by your
code after the loop ends — same as before. Giving the model direct
write access to the ontology would be a significantly bigger trust
boundary than is appropriate here, given it's selecting among LLM-
suggested actions based on web content it does not fully control.

times — there is no fixed sequence you must follow. Good practice, but not a strict rule:
  - It's often useful to check the knowledge graph first (query_graph) to see what's already
    known about this manufacturer (prior policy URL, last-modified date, which regulations
    they're scored against) before spending a web search on it.
  - If a search result looks ambiguous (e.g. could be a cookie-notice page, a blog post about
    privacy, or a terms-of-service page rather than the actual policy), fetch it and check the
    text before trusting the title/snippet alone.
  - Stop and call finish() once you're reasonably confident, or once you've made a genuine
    effort and concluded nothing reliable exists — don't loop indefinitely.

Always end by calling finish() with your decision."""
